      <div>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Samuel Itiola, and I am a budding cloud engineer with a passion for building scalable, efficient, and secure cloud solutions. Currently, I am pursuing a Diploma in Cloud Engineering with AltSchool Africa, where I am honing my skills in virtualization, containerization, cloud architecture, and DevOps practices. My curiosity for technology and drive to solve complex problems inspire me to explore how cloud platforms can revolutionize industries.</p>
        <h2>Cloud Engineering Journey</h2>
        <p>At AltSchool Africa, I am gaining hands-on experience with leading cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. I am mastering the art of deploying and managing virtual machines, automating infrastructure with tools like Terraform, and orchestrating containerized applications using Kubernetes and Docker. Additionally, I am developing proficiency in serverless computing, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud security best practices. Cloud engineering excites me because it merges technical innovation with real-world impact. I thrive on designing solutions that are not only efficient but also resilient and adaptable, empowering businesses to achieve their goals seamlessly.</p>
        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>Before diving into cloud engineering, I built a strong foundation in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), where I applied technology to analyze and manage spatial data. My previous roles allowed me to lead large-scale geospatial projects, automate workflows using FME, and utilize Python scripting to streamline data processing. These experiences cultivated my problem-solving mindset and my ability to design efficient, data-driven solutions. As an Administrative Assistant at Light Care Haven, I am leveraging my organizational and analytical skills while expanding my knowledge in cloud infrastructure and its applications. My transition from GIS to cloud engineering underscores my adaptability and eagerness to embrace emerging technologies</p>
        <h2>Key Skills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cloud Platforms: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud</li>
            <li>Virtualization & Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes</li>
            <li>Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform, Ansible</li>
            <li>Automation & DevOps: CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins, GitHub Actions</li>
            <li>Programming: Python, Bash scripting</li>
            <li>Cloud Security: Identity and Access Management (IAM), encryption, monitoring</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why Cloud Engineering</h2>
        <p>I find immense satisfaction in the scalability and flexibility cloud platforms bring to modern computing. Virtualization and containerization fascinate me because they simplify resource management and application deployment, making innovation accessible to organizations of all sizes. The ability to optimize workflows, reduce costs, and ensure reliability in cloud environments is what motivates me to excel in this field.</p>
        <h2>Personal Interest</h2>
        <p>When I’m not immersed in cloud projects, I enjoy staying active through hiking and exploring new technology trends. I also love engaging in tech communities, learning from peers, and sharing knowledge through workshops and discussions. My background in GIS and interest in cloud computing allow me to envision a future where spatial analysis is seamlessly integrated with cloud technologies for smarter decision-making.</p>

            Project Summary: Landing Page Deployment on a Cloud Server  
        </h2>
        <p>This project demonstrates the foundational skills required to provision a Linux server, configure a web server, and deploy a basic web application, showcasing the ability to set up a production-ready environment. The goal is to create a simple yet effective prototype to demonstrate the team’s technical capabilities to potential investors.</p>
        <h3>
            Key Objectives
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Server Provisioning</li>
            <p>Utilize a virtualization or cloud platform (e.g., AWS EC2) to create a Linux-based virtual server. For this project, the Ubuntu operating system was chosen for its stability, community support, and ease of use.</p>
            <li>Web Server Setup</li>
            <p>Install and configure a web server, such as Apache or Nginx, to serve static content. This ensures the server can handle HTTP requests and display the HTML page to end users.</p>
            <li>HTML Page Development and Deployment</li>
            <p>Create a simple and informative HTML landing page containing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developer’s name.</li>
                <li>Project title: "Welcome to [Your Name] Landing Page.</li>
                <li>A brief project description summarizing its purpose</li>
                <li>A detailed bio containing engaging and interesting personal/professional information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Deploy the HTML page on the configured server so it can be accessed over the internet.</p>
            <li>Networking Configuration</li>
            <p>Configure the server to allow HTTP traffic (port 80) through the firewall to ensure accessibility from any browser. The public IP address or domain name will be shared for demonstration purposes.</p>
